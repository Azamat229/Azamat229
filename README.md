#As a Backend Developer at Advmeds, I develop and maintain cloud medical information systems that provide cross-platform and cross-system solutions for healthcare services. I use C#, SQL, and #Entity Framework Core to create reliable, scalable, and secure back-end applications that integrate with various front-end platforms and databases. 

#I have over 1 years of experience in back-end development, working in different types of companies, such as outstaff, and product-oriented. I have also led a team of three developers at my #previous job, where I was responsible for decision-making, customer communication. I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from IUCA, where I learned the fundamentals of #software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and databases. I am passionate about creating innovative and impactful digital solutions for the medical and healthcare industry, and I am #always eager to learn new skills and technologies.
